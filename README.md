Project Name: Sensor Fusion Online Filter

Overview

This project aims to develop a software that performs online filtering of multi-sensor data. The filter integrates the data from multiple sensors in real-time to produce a more accurate and reliable estimate of the underlying system state. The filter can handle different types of sensor data, including but not limited to, GPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU), magnetometer, and camera data.

The software is developed in Python and uses various open-source libraries for sensor data processing and filtering. The software provides an easy-to-use interface to configure the filter parameters and visualize the sensor data and estimated state.

Installation

To install the Sensor Fusion Online Filter, follow the below steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/\<your-username\>/sensor-fusion-online-filter.git
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

To use the Sensor Fusion Online Filter, follow the below steps:

Import the filter class: from sensor_fusion_online_filter import SensorFusionOnlineFilter
Initialize the filter with the sensor data: filter = SensorFusionOnlineFilter(sensor_data)
Update the filter with the latest sensor data: filter.update(sensor_data)
Get the estimated state: state = filter.get_state()
